Its just a django container


* Usage
** Starting container and creating at the same time a django project
   Maybe you have not created django project yet and just by running container passing a container name is enough to create the django projet and run django server at that for you.
   To do that, see below...
  #+Begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/wagnermarques/Fedora-Dockerfiles.git
  cd Fedora-Dockerfiles/Django

  #To run the container use this pattern
  #The intent is that the container name should be the same name of the django project
  ./docker-run.sh container_run_command container_name 

  #So, to start a new django project and runserver at this...
  ./docker-run.sh django-admin-start-project mydjangoprojectname 

  #+End_Src
** Staring container for a alredy created project
   Maybe you alredy have been create a jdango project and the folder of the project reside in a specific path
   So, you will want the container just run that project.
   Lets say you have a django project called "mysite"
   The project folder resides in the path:

   /home/yourusername/pythonprojects/mysite

   1) You need pass pythonprojects dir as volume for container folder /django_project
      To do that just change the docker-run.sh script line below
      #+Begin_src
      VOLUME_PATH_for_django_project_dir="/run/media/wagner/96fea5f1-d297-4f63-a035-abf6511467be/wagnerdocri@gmail.com2/envs/env-dev/pythonprojects/"
      #+End_src
      to 
      #+Begin_src
      VOLUME_PATH_for_django_project_dir="/home/yourusername/pythonprojects/"
      #+End_src
   2) Start the container for your project
      Use the name of you project folder as the name of the container, like below
      #+Begin_src
      ./docker-run.sh mysite
      #+End_src
